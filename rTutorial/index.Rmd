## Getting Started

Setup is very easy

- Download R from CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network)
  - http://cran.r-project.org
  - Unpack and install per instructions
  - Comes bundled with an editor, but we will use RStudio
- Install the RStudio editor
  - http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
- After launching RStudio, install packages in 2 ways:
  - Use the Console: e.g. `install.packages(plyr)`
  - Use the GUI: Tools -> Install Packages ...

---

## Basics - Navigating in RStudio
+ R code is executed in the ___Editor___ or the ___Console___.
+ The UI provides windows for viewing data, plots, package documentation, variables, as well as code versionining
+ The Console does tab-completion and provides documentation help

## Basics - Basic R Data Types
R has three basic data types:
```{r}
x <- 1.0
y <- "abc"
z <- FALSE
cat("x is a", class(x), ", y is a", class(y), "and z is", class(z))
```

(`cat()` is a convenience function which prints the input values)

---

## Basics - Other Data Types
A few other data types worth learning:
+ Vector (1-dimensional container for data of __one__ type)
+ Matrix (2-dimensional container for data of __one__ type)
+ Factor (represents a categorical variable)
+ Lists are collections named values
+ __Data Frame__ (similar to a SQL table or a MS Excel spreadsheet)
```{r}
vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
fac <- as.factor(vec)
lis <- list(a = 1, b = c(1, 2, 3), c = "hello")
mat <- matrix(rnorm(100, -2, 4.5), 25, 4)
df <- data.frame(rnorm(c(100, 2), c(10, 20), c(12, 22)))
horsemen <- as.factor(c("White", "Red", "Black", "Pale"))
```

---

## Basics - A Note about the Environment

Code runs within an _environment_, and the variables used are saved in that environment; To find out the contents call:
```{r}
ls()
```
To remove variables from the environment:
```{r}
rm(horsemen)
ls()
```

## Other Useful Functions
The usual math functions are available in R as expected: `sqrt`, `sum`, `log`, `exp`, etc.  Alongside, these may also prove useful:
+ `str()` provides a short summary of the value passed in
+ `as.Date` converts character variables to dates
+ `apply` takes a vector or data frame and a function, and applies the function to each element
+ `paste()` is useful for concatenating strings together into 1 string
+ `gsub()` substitutes substrings within strings
+ `rep()` repeates the passed in value a specified number of times
+ `plot()` is a versatile function for plotting lines, scatter plots, etc.
+ `hist()` takes a vector and produces a histogram of the data; internally calls `plot()`

Furthermore, packages built for R allow for more complicated modelling, accessing a variety of databases, interacting with data from other systems, and convenience methods for problems in specific domains.  There are too many to cover.

## Some Other Amazing Packages
+ GoogleVis: a Google package for visualization
+ rCharts: awesome dynamic charts package
+ slidify: for creating presentations using R Markdown
+ sqldf: for writing SQL against data frames
+ stringr: string manipulation library
+ tseries and zoo: timeseries functionality
+ RMySQL, RPostgreSQL, rmongodb, RODBC, RDI
+ RCurl for http requests
+ reshape2: a data frame manipulation tool
+ foreach: write fast parallel loops in R

## Writing functions and control-flow
R allows you to write your own scripts, as well as custom-made functions:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
upperLower <- function(frame) {
  orders <- frame$orders[frame$orders > 0]
  return(list(upper = max(orders) / mean(orders), lower = min(orders) / mean(orders)))
}

splitFrame <- function(frame) {
  frame$highGMS = FALSE
  for(i in 1:nrow(frame)) {
    if(frame$gms > 10000) {
      frame$highGMS[i] = TRUE
    }
  }
  frame
}
```

R supports `if() {} else {}` statements as well as ''for'' and ''while'' loops.

## Working With Data Frames I

Think of a __Data Frame__ as an in-memory SQL table containing various columns (of different type) and rows.  We can read and write data from and to a file:
```{r}
df <- read.csv("../rTutorial/data.csv", header = FALSE)
colnames(df) <- c("date", "mid", "sid", "clicks", "orders", "gms")
df$date <- as.Date(df$date, format = "%d-%b-%y")
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
write.csv("../rTutorial/new_data.csv")
```
and view useful information about it:
```{r}
str(df)
```

---


## Working With Data Frames II
The 'summary()' function is a multi-purpose function which displays relevant statistics about each column (it has different uses depending on the type of variable passed in)
```{r}
summary(df)
```

---


## Working With Data Frames III
We will typically be interested in looking at subsets of our data
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# first 100 rows and columns 2, 3, 4, and 5
subset0 <- df[1:100, 2:5]
# all rows with mid 3184 and columns "orders" and "gms"
subset1 <- df[df$mid == 3184, c("orders", "gms")]
# vector of dates when mid 25003 had GMS > $10k
subset2 <- df$date[(df$mid == 25003) & (df$gms > 10000)]
```
Subsetting data in R is very flexible and allows you to quickly find and explore the relevant dataset.  Each entry
passed in (such as `df$mid == 25003`) is a boolean vector having the value `TRUE` where the MID matches 25003.  Passing
this boolean vector into a `[]` returns a data frame for all selection where `TRUE` happened.

## Basic Regression Modeling
To run a basic linear model, R provides the `lm()` function in the `stats` package;  Using the example data previously loaded:
```{r}
model <- lm(log(gms) ~ log(orders) + log(clicks), df, (mid == 3184) & (orders > 0))
summary(model)
```

---


## split-apply-combine with `plyr`
First install the `plyr` package with `install.packages("plyr")` and load it:
```{r}
require(plyr)
```

A common operation encountered in data analysis is splitting the data frame by a criteria (e.g. for each MID), applying functions to each block e.g. the mean of the GMS column, and the max number of orders), and returning a data frame with the results.  The `plyr` code is simple:
```{r}
grouped <- ddply(df, .(mid), summarize, avg_gms = mean(gms), max_orders = max(orders))
head(grouped, n = 6)
```

---


## Plotting with `ggplot2`
Visualization is an important component of statistical analysis and the `ggplot2` package can generate intuitive plots.  The package adds layers on top of the base `ggplot()` result, thus composing the result:
```{r warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
require(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(data = df, aes(clicks, gms))
g + geom_point() + ggtitle("Clicks vs Orders")
```
More Examples...

## The `shiny` web framework for sharing results
`shiny` is a package developed by RStudio to allow users of R to make their visualizations and results available and interactive in any browser.  The package expects `ui.R` and `server.R` to be present in the current directory before running `runApp()`.  The two files specify the layout of the UI and the data processing, respectively.  The below code was taken from the `shiny` tutorial:
![](shiny_example.png "Example of ui.R and server.R for `shiny`")
Demo!
